#Temporary TODO
  - Register any changes in module with a service, this should be checked before any navigation is allowed
  - Smart-table TODOs
  -- Add support for multiple select (requires data.objectstore()) from a <smart-table>
  -- Add support for custom footers for <smart-table>
  -- Add support for infinite scrolling/Virtual Scrolling to <smart-table>


### util.js ###
 * Create a file called util.js with utility functions including:
 ** util.mixin(object1, object2) -- mixes (deep copy) two objects together.
 
### data.js ###
 * Createa a file called data.js to keep "stores" in.
 ** data.objectstore() -- Essentially a clone of the Dojo Memory store,
     perhaps with an updated API.
