#Temporary TODO
  -Register any changes in module with a service, this should be checked before any navigation is allowed
  -/Remove Bootstrap.css (yw @jniles), too much padding and white space, design simple and compact layout using normalise etc. (see the GNU thing)/
  -Style for Fiscal Year, Enterprise Select and Application Utility buttons (This should not just be default bootstrap)
  - Register any changes in module with a service, this should be checked before any navigation is allowed

  -- Add support for custom footers for <smart-table>

### util.js ###
 * Create a file called util.js with utility functions including:
 ** util.mixin(object1, object2) -- mixes (deep copy) two objects together.
 
### data.js ###
 * Create a file called data.js to keep "stores" in.
 ** data.objectstore() -- Essentially a clone of the Dojo Memory store,
     perhaps with an updated API.
