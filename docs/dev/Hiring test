Jonathan's Ideas

Theoretical Questions:

1. Explain the respective roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating a dynamic web site.

  Best Answer) HTML provides the structure of the document, as well as content.  CSS layers on top of HTML to add
    style and minimal interactivity.  JavaScript render the page dynamic, allowing for components to be loaded dynamically, or
    upon user input, as well as editting the Document Object Model.

2. What is a Version Control System (VCS) and why is it important?  Examples of VCS are Git, Subversion, Bazaar.

  Best Answer) Version Control Systems are programs which add time-stamped versioning to documents in the file system, and support
    rolling back changes on files.  In large teams, they are critical for collaborative development, to ensure that people can work
    on the same code base and merge changes seamlessly.  Finally, they contain some advanced features such as branching, rebasing,
    and remote repositories which protect your code by distributing copies of the files and allowing ease of collaborative development.

3. What role does the server play in client/server web architecture?  What role does the client play?
  
  Best Answer) In the client/server web model, the server's primary job is to host the code and send it to the client upon request
    (i.e. to serve), along with files, documents, images, and other data.  While some cacheing technologies allow the client to 
    hold application code, the server generally must contain all code to allow new clients to connect.  In addition to holding the 
    application, the server holds any shared data between clients, lists of client connections, manages the encryption of connections,
    and permissions/security of the website.

    The client is responsible for requesting, downloading, and executing code from the server.  Furthermore, the client is responsible
    for rendering the application or files sent from the server, and presents a canvas for user interactivity.

4. What advantages do RDBMS offer over a regular file system?
  
  Best Answer) Relational Database Management Systems are built to scale multiple users (or millions) reading, writing, and removing data 
  from the same database.  In this respect, they are much better at resolving conflicts when multiple users wish to access or modify the 
  same record, and maintain good performance even when lots of reads and writes are occuring simultaneously.  Databases also impose a data
  model on the file system, allowing the database engine to reject certain data if they are do not fit the same type (INT or TEXT) and provide
  a structured way to relate pieces of data together through use of keys.  Relational databases also support INDEXes which allow extremely
  fast lookups of data, much faster than file systems.  Most RDBMSs support versioning natively, so that transactions can be "rolled back"
  to their previous state before a modification or removal.  Finally, databases are often very portable.  For example, SQLite is composed of
  a single flat file that runs almost all operating systems one can imagine.

Practical Questions

1. Write pseudo code to sort the following array in increasing order.  The code to generate the array of random numbers is included for reference.

//
// var array = Array.apply(null, { length : 100 }).map(Function.call, function () { return Math.round(100 * Math.random()); });
// console.log(array);
